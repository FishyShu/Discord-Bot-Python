## [Unreleased]

---

## [1.3.0] - 2026-03-22

### Added
- **AI Chatbot system** (`cogs/ai.py`, `utils/ai_db.py`, `utils/ai_prompt.py`, `utils/ai_router.py`)
  - Responds in configured active channels and to @mentions everywhere
  - Response length control (Short / Medium / Long) via `/ai config length` and dashboard
  - Three personality modes: Manual system prompt, Preset, Auto-generate from description
  - Five built-in presets: Friendly Helper, Anime Waifu, Professional Assistant, Caine (TADC), Winston (Overwatch)
  - Behaviour flags: markdown frequency, emoji toggle, mention on reply, Discord quote-reply, typing indicator
  - Webhook persona — custom name and avatar per server via Discord webhook
  - Long-term memory per user via `/ai memory`
  - Web search injection (DuckDuckGo) and URL summarisation
  - Image generation via `/imagine` (fal.ai with Pollinations.ai fallback)
  - Per-server blocklist — refuse to discuss configured topics
  - Bring-your-own API key support (Claude, GPT-4o, premium Gemini) with encryption
  - AI dashboard section: personality, behaviour, webhook persona, channels, blocklist, API key
- **AI image generation fix** — `/imagine` now downloads the image before sending as a `discord.File` attachment (was showing a blank embed)
- **Sparkly console output** (`utils/console.py`) — colourful startup banner, per-level icons and colours, ANSI support on Windows
- **Dashboard: Tone improvements** — dropdown shows descriptions, Custom tone option with free-text input
- **Language enforcement** — language rule is now prepended as a highest-priority directive so it is respected even with strong character presets
- **Moderation cog** (`cogs/moderation.py`) — `/kick`, `/ban`, `/unban`, `/softban`, `/timeout`, `/warn`, `/warnings`, `/purge`
- **Mod log** — `/modlog [user] [moderator]` queries persistent action history; `/delwarn <id>` deletes a warning by case ID
- **Anti-raid protection** (`cogs/antiraid.py`) — mass join detection, new account filter, mention/message spam; `/antiraid set/show/lockdown/unlock`
- **Ghost ping detection** — audit log alerts when a mention is removed via edit or deleted message
- **Giveaway system** (`cogs/giveaways.py`) — timed giveaways with auto-end, winner announcement, and reroll
- **Server backup** (`cogs/backup.py`) — export/import full server bot configuration as JSON
- **Auto-translate** (`cogs/autotranslate.py`) — per-channel automatic message translation
- **Fun commands** (`cogs/fun.py`) — `/meme`, `/joke`, `/8ball`, `/coinflip`, `/roll`, `/mock`, `/ship`, and more

### Fixed
- Webhook avatar stored as string `"None"` instead of SQL NULL causing webhook sends to fail silently
- `/imagine` sending a blank embed — fixed by downloading image before attaching
